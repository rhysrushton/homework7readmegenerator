# Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator

## Incomplete

I can't figure out how to complete this homework, once the answer comes out I will go over it and update accordingly. 
The main thing I couldn't work out was how to combine all the data within a main function. The api function and readme function seem right.
